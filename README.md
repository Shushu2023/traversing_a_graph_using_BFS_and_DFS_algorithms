# traversing_a_graph_using_BFS_and_DFS_algorithms
The Node class represents a simple node in a graph.  It has a name field (String data type) and an adjacency list (ArrayList of Node objects) that contains a list of all Nodes that are adjacent to it.
The Graph class will be a driver class that represents a graph.
It contains code that reads a list of nodes and their adjacent nodes from a GraphInfo.txt file, and creates an ArrayList of Nodes that are in the graph.
The Graph class contains breadthFirstSearch method and depthFirstSearch method, they  perform the steps defined in the algorithms.  
breadthFirstSearch() - implement the BFS traversal algorithm 
depthFirstSearch() - implement the DFS traversal algorithm
